# AVL Trees

When the elements are inserted in sorted order, the tree structure in a binary tree looks similar to that of linear linked list.
Hence the operations like insertion and deletion will have O(n) time complexity. In such a case Avl Trees are used.
In Avl tree, after every insertion it is checked whether the tree is balanced or not with the help of a height of a tree.
Based on it the tree is rotated left or right.
